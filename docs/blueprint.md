## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 50%, 50%) -> #3391FF. A moderate, versatile blue suggestive of clarity and efficiency. Steer clear of cliches of blue for construction, like steel or workwear blue.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) -> #F0F6FF. A light and desaturated tint of blue, that complements the primary without stealing attention.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) -> #1AB2B2. A contrasting teal-ish blue/green that serves well to highlight calls to action. Should work both in light and dark modes.
- Body text: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, suitable for body text
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', A proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel; suitable for headlines.
- Minimalist line icons to represent different modules and actions.
- Clean, card-based layouts with a focus on readability and user experience.
- Subtle transitions and animations for UI elements to enhance user interaction.
